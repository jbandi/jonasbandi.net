> I am passionate about technology and methodologies - always trying to learn,
> improve and share knowledge.

I am working as a freelance developer and as a coach and trainer.

My current passion lies in bringing modern frontend development to traditional
enterprise projects.

Coming from a Java & .NET background I am now primarily working with JavaScript,
Angular & React.  
In the past years I shared my knowledge in dozens of in-house workshops at
companies all over Switzerland. I am also a lecturer at the University of
Applied Sciences (BFH) in Bern.
