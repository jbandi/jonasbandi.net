- You probably donâ€™t need a single-page application  
  https://journal.plausible.io/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app  
  An argumentation against building Single Page Applications as the default for
  any project. There are many advantages of server-side rendered web
  applications. Choosing a single page application should be a conscious
  decision based on concrete project requirements.

- Turbolinks: An alternative to SPAs?  
  https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks/blob/master/README.md  
  Turbolinks are an interesting technology that promise to deliver some
  advantages of single page applications while still being a classical
  server-side rendered application.

- TSLint is dead, long live ESLint  
  https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9  
  I guess a lot of projects will have to switch their linter in the near future
  ... hopefully the Angular CLI makes the transition easy ...

- Blazor, a new framework for browser-based .NET  
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe8UW5543-s  
  I believe WebAssembly will trigger a new wave of frameworks and has the
  potential to overhaul how we create complex web applications. This has the
  potential to increase productivity by factors over current frameworks
  (Angular, React, Vue). I think/hope Balzor is just the first of a new
  generation of frameworks. Similar frameworks outside of .NET will follow. I am
  surprised how mature it already looks in this presentation.  
  However after playing with it, I see that debugging is currently a major
  blocker.

- Blazor Example:

- Blazor Workshop  
  https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop. A free tutorial how
  to build a Blazor app.

- Blazor Roadmap  
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt848631.aspx  
  Blazor is part of .NET Core 3 as 'Razor Components' ... however this seems not
  to be the the client-side runtime based on WebAssembly. It seems they are
  trying to create a component model that can be used for server- and
  client-side development ... I hope they are not trying to mix up too much
  here!
