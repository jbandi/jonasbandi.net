### Week 7

- SWC: An alternative to Babel  
  https://swc-project.github.io/blog/2019/02/08/Introducing-swc-1.0  
  A transpiler much faster than Babel with the same features... really?

- Lazy Load Non-Routable Modules in Angular  
  https://netbasal.com/the-need-for-speed-lazy-load-non-routable-modules-in-angular-30c8f1c33093
  A guide how you can implement lazy-loading in Angular without being coupled to
  the Angular router. Crazy complicated, compared to other frameworks ... I
  think [`<lazy-af>`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@herodevs/lazy-af) is
  warpping that aproach into a component.

- easy-peasy - a state management library for react  
  https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy  
  This looks like the version of the Redux pattern I like. The advantages of
  Redux but the ease of use of traditional OO: calling functions to modify
  state. Of course leveraging React Hooks.

- Immutability Changes Everything  
  http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf  
  Interesting paper. Some arguments why immutability becomes more popular
  recently.

- Effective Snapshot Testing  
  https://blog.kentcdodds.com/effective-snapshot-testing-e0d1a2c28eca  
  I still have not used snapshot testing in any of my projects. I am still
  sceptical about its value. This article adresses some of the scepticism.

- UI AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT  
  https://michel.codes/blogs/ui-as-an-afterthought  
  Thooughts about state management in React from the creator of MobX. The big
  topic is decoupling logic from presentation. Especially interesting the claim
  that [react-apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) leads to
  unwanted coupling.

- Hacker News: Discussion about decoupling logic and presentation  
  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19067302 Some intersting points in these
  discussions concerning mangaing state in a component tree.

- Lambda and serverless is one of the worst forms of proprietary lock-in we've
  ever seen.  
  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/06/coreos_kubernetes_v_world/  
  Old article but still interesting read. Especially the monthly AWS cost of 1
  Mio ...
